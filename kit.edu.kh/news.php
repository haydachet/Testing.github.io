                    <h3 class="blog_title">Start accepting Japanese students </h3>
           
                    <p class="blog_summary">Kirirom Institute of Technology (Kingdom of Cambodia・kampong speu province, president: Takeshi Izuka) also known as KIT, is accepting entrance of Japanese students from April 2018.

In the 21st century, technology has advanced dramatically and the requirement for “talented person wanted = person wanted by the society” is also changing exponentially. The number of engineers who can develop and make full use of AI, robot, AR, 3D printer, drone, VR and other latest technologies are in real short. Yet universities in Japan does not provide enough chances for the students to learn them. KIT, built in Cambodia’s Kirirom National Park, was built to attack and solve this national size problem. KIT provides world’s latest studying environment surrounded by nature. Currently, there are students from 1st year to 3rd year studying and involved in system design construction of entire vKirirom nature city such as resort development and college town development. As acquisition of English and IT skills by the Cambodian students has been confirmed, acceptance of the Japanese students was decided.<br>

We are waiting for high school students, parents, educators who are seeking for the first step to change the world through their own skills from KIT.<br><br>

[KIT characteristics]<br>
• Nature integrated highland resort and campus<br>
• University exists as part of large-scale project approved by CDC (Council for the Development of Cambodia)<br>
• Academic-industrial collaboration curriculum with growing companies<br>

*1 All Cambodian students receive scholarship sponsors from Japanese companies which covers 4 years of living and school fees. Instead, students have the obligation to work with the matched company for at least 4 years.

• About KIT<br>
https://www.kirirom.info/
Globalization has taken place and talented engineers who are capable of it and able to use both Japanese and English are wanted in the labour market including IT companies. However, it is a fact that Japan is short of such engineers. Moreover, aging society with low birth rate accelerates the short of human resources and there is a huge need of training talented people for the whole Asia. KIT was founded as an international university up in the mountain belonging to Kirirom National Park which is 112km away from the capital of Phnom Penh. We conduct world’s leading education system and make the students to become the world’s leading education system, we make high potential talented students of Cambodia and Asia to become work-ready for companies.
