            <p>
                Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering prepares students to design and build software systems.
                Software is essential to the functioning of modern society but high quality software is very challenging
                to create. Software engineering focuses on the knowledge and skills to meet that challenge and create
                high quality software on schedule within budget.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Software Engineering curriculum addresses a full range of software activities including gathering
                client requirements, designing and constructing software solutions, testing software, and modifying and
                extending existing systems. The curriculum also recognizes that most software is developed by teams, and
                students develop skills in project management, and team operation. Graduates are well-prepared to
                function as software engineering team members and also move toward software engineering management.
            </p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                The core courses address programming and use of software development tools, specification and design,
                software architecture, verification and validation, software evolution, and team projects. These courses
                are supplemented with courses drawn from computer science and Information Technology that provide both
                theoretical and practical background and application knowledge. The full curriculum prepares the
                students to apply processes, methods, and tools to the problem of building and maintaining software with
                a defined level of quality, at a predictable cost, on a predictable schedule.
