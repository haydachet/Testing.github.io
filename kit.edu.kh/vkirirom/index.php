									<h3>Modern Khmer Restaurant</h3>
									<span>No.1 restaurant within a 70km range, On top of Kirirom Mountain.</span>
									<p>Although there are many good Khmer foods in our restaurants, what makes us different is
that our restaurant stands amongst the pine trees of kirirom Mountain. The sound of the wind against the pine trees gives a smoothing sound to the ears while enjoying our dishes!</p>
									<p>Khmer food cuisine, cooked with fresh vegetables and fruits picked straight from our organic garden by our experience chef</p>
									<p>Customers will enjoy the freshness of the air as well as the surrounding beauty of the pine trees. The greenery and the Pine View Kitchen Restaurant are extremely perfect for your vacation and holidays.</p>
									<p>Please stopover for a cup of coffee as you visit Kirirom National Park.</p><br>
