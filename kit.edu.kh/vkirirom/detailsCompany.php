							<p>vKirirom Pine Resort is located among the pine trees. We always carefully think about the nature , in order not to destroy the beautiful environment. As we proceed our construction, we try not to cut so many trees. We keep the policy that we cut only trees which are rust, or broken. Otherwise, we try to keep the trees as they are as much as possible.<br><br>

Moreover, we grow some vegetables and fruits without chemical, to serve at the restaurant.<br><br>

We also try to reuse the natural resource. We make chacol by cut trees, and fertilizer by garbage.<br><br>

We place the importance to live with the nature.</p>

What is more, this orange reminds us of the clothes of monks seen in Cambodia. </p>
